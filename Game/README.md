RAIDEN 

Raiden is a scrolling shoot'em up arcade game where you controls a ship and kills other ships or aliens.
The objective is to destroy all the enemies you see and pass all the levels of the game.
This kind of games are trully difficult and frenetic because there are thousands of enemies and projectiles
that you need to avoid, but it's very addictive.

Plot: In the year 2090, the Earth is being attacked by aliens known as the Cranassians.
During the invasion, the World Alliance Military is building a new aircraft based on a 
captured alien craft, the Raiden Supersonic Attack Fighter.
